### Executable Jar File
If you want the executable jar file you can download a stable release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy/releases/latest) or the latest dev version from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/RaphiMC/ViaProxy/actions/workflows/build.yml) or the [ViaVersion Jenkins](https://ci.viaversion.com/view/All/job/ViaProxy/).

### Docker Image
ViaProxy docker images can be found on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/ViaVersion/ViaProxy/pkgs/container/viaproxy).

```bash
docker run -it -v /path/to/run:/app/run -p 25568:25568 ghcr.io/viaversion/viaproxy:latest

where ``/path/to/run`` is the path where the ViaProxy data should be stored and ``25568`` is the port ViaProxy should listen on.
